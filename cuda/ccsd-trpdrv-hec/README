The program arguments are as follows:
./test nocc nvir [maxiter] [nkpass]
- nocc is 40 to 200
- nvir is 5 to 10 times nocc
- maxiter defaults to 100. With a ccuda simulator or a GPU, you can get away with 10 iterations or less.
- nkpass is usually optional.  If you run a very large problem like nvir=2000, youâ€™ll need to set nkpass>1 to fit into 4 GB.
