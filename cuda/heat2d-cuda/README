This benchmark performs a discreet 2D laplacian operation a number of times on a given vector. The benchmark evaluates the performance of nearest neighboring single hop stencil operations.  The CUDA version is compared to a version using SSE intrinsics which runs on the CPU. 

Python files are included to create an initial vector (mkinit.py) and to visualize the resulting vector. The application can be thought of as evolving the 2D heat equation on a given initial heat distribution. The GPU result is validated by comparing it with the CPU result.

The benchmark code was originally developed under the Cyprus Research Promotion Foundation (RPF) project "GPU Clusterware".
